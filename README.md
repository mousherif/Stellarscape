# Game Update || Version 0.1pa
## Commit Notes ðŸ“‘
- Bullet holes are being implemented at the moment, but are very buggy. I will commit to the repo once they're fixed.
- Weapon Leaning has been implemented in the game; works very nicely.
- Weapon bobbing has been fixed and works totally fine now.
- Sliding is to be removed from the game when I get around to commiting a new update to the repo again.
- Previous issues with bullet tunneling (not registering collisions) have since been fixed.
## Afterword ðŸ©µ
- <a href="https://medium.com/@nubb" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;" >Check out devlogs here!</a>
- Video showcase of bullet hole bug. Hopefully I'll be able to fix this by the end of the week, since I'm moving real slow at the moment and need to pick up the pace if I want to get an Alpha test out by March :/
