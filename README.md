# Game Update || Commit 11
## Commit Notes ðŸ“’
- Implemented procedural recoil for weapons. This is not tuned specifically for each weapon *yet*, but the alpha vesion should have such as a feature.
- Jumping has been finally added to the game, as well as sliding. Sliding is rather iffy and requires very fine user input, so it might be removed altogether sicne it's very buggy at the moment.
- Weaponm bobbing (similar to head bobbing/head bob effect) has been implemented, but very buggy. This may be removed for now or be updated later down the line.
- Bullet tracers and casings have been added to the game. Accurate for all weapon ammunition.
- The FPS counter ingame is far more accurate than beforehand.
